# Dota2MMRtracker
This is a desktop application that tracks the MMR of Dota Players with different usernames. The application can show their statistics and graph of their progress.
Running the application will create a "users" folder in the directory of the python scripts. It is inside the users folder where the different .txt files are stored (Each user has a text file).
